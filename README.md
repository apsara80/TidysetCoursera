# Getting and Cleaning Data: Coursera Final Project

This repository was created for the Getting and Cleaning Data course on Coursera. The main objective of this project is to demonstrate one's ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.

The data used for this project are provided by the course instructor, with the following description: 

One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing - see for example this article . Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A [full description] (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones) is available at the site where the data was obtained:



This repository contains four files: 
        
1. **README.md**: Gives an overview of this project 

2. **Codebook.md**: Includes all the variable/object names and descriptions, and explains each step of the data maniplations completed in the R script (run_analysis.R).

3. **run_analysis.R**: Is the R script that transforms the downloaded (raw) data into the final, tidy data set. 

4. **tidyset.txt**: Is the final product of this project, showing the averages of each measure (means and standard deviations) by subject, and by activity. 

The R script was created using R Version 3.6.0 with RStudio Version 1.2.1335 on macOS Mojave Version 10.14.4.
